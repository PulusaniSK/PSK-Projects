In this notebook, we'll delve into this phenomenon using age distribution data to investigate if we can replicate a difference in average age at death solely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, debunking the notion of early death for left-handers. The notebook employs pandas and Bayesian statistics to examine the likelihood of being a certain age at death given that you're reported as left-handed or right-handed.

A survey conducted by National Geographic in 1986 garnered over a million responses, including age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. Researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki analyzed this data and observed that rates of left-handedness were approximately 13% for individuals under 40 but declined with age to about 5% by the age of 80. They concluded, based on the analysis of a subgroup of people who throw left-handed but write right-handed, that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness. This implies that the rates aren't solely influenced by age but rather by the year of birth. If the same study were conducted today, we would anticipate a shifted version of the same distribution based on age. Ultimately, we'll examine the impact of this changing rate on the apparent mean age of death of left-handed individuals, but let's kick things off by plotting the rates of left-handedness as a function of age.

This notebook utilizes two datasets: death distribution data for the United States from the year 1999 (source website here) and rates of left-handedness digitized from a figure in a 1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki.
